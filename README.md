I jumped ship from javascript in favor of python because:
1. math.js is just a little too cumbersome for my taste
2. I figured out javascript enough and am losing interest in all the work that would go into making a form people can fill in and formatting vega graphs etc.
3. I discovered jupyter and I could make a notebook and share its github link to mybinder.org and people could edit the input plate and boom
4. Pint looks like a nice units lib, and mpld3 looks like a nice graphing lib
5. Jupyter lets you render LaTeX math in markdown <3

js code is still in the git history
