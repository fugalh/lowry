I'm trying to get this to work for my plane but the results are nonsensical. I'm pretty sure my flight tests are ok, or at least in the ballpark, so I think the issue must be related to the gear reduction of the high-RPM Rotax to the propeller. I'm working through the notion that torque is not the same through a gear, which is probably the problem (n0 is rps of the prop but P0 or M0 are in terms of the engine)

I'll put this back (or in a separate notebook) once I resolve it.
