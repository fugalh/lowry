- refactor to a PoLA ch7 notebook focused on closely matching the graphs, as a GAK smoke test, separate notebook for fill-in-the-blank charts (dynamic bounds)
- add config options to plate
  - velocity unit
  - ceiling
  - Vs0 and Vne
- factor chart code out of notebook
- allow defining cas -> ias

# TODO 
# figure 7.10 ROC vs W
# figure 7.12 ROS vs CAS
# figure 7.13 glide angle vs CAS
# figure 7.14 max ROC vs h_rho

# Vx, Vy, Vbg, Vmd, Vh calibrated vs DA at gross and solo
# some kind of headwind/tailwind;altitude;tas graph
# a weight -> %decrease nomogram? or even better weight -> each v speed
